# Migrate Hyperledger Composer projects to Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.x with Loopback v4
Migrate existing Hyperledger Composer blockchain applications to v1.4 or later by adding a Loopback v4 REST api

## Step I
[create](./docs/LOOPBACK-GETTING-STARTED.md) an empty Loopback v4 nodeJS application

## Step II
[generate](./docs/SWAGGER-CODEGEN.md) Loopback v4 API rest endpoints from your swagger.json

## Step III
[wire up](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2) Loopback v4 controllers to a Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 blockchain network, by following along the popular IBM code-pattern [Create a fair trade supply chain network
